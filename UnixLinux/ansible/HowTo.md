###  How To Change Port Number For GlassFish
Both Oracle an GlassFish runs by default on port number 8080,results in port conflict
Following are simple steps to change the port number of glassfish server :

Go to the folder where Glassfish is installed.
Locate config folder which is as follows: C:\Program Files\glassfish-3.0.1\glassfish\domains\domain1\config
Open domain.xml using any text editor.
Look for 8080 and change it to some other port number that doesnâ€™t conflict with other port numbers.
Save domain.xml.
Now  remove GlassFish from NetBeans and add it again so that NetBeans IDE understands the new port number.
Restart GlassFish, if it was already running.
